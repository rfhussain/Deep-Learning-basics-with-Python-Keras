# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a part of [Machine Learning](https://github.com/rfhussain/Topic-Modeling-with-Python-Scikit-LDA/blob/master/machine-learning.md) technique. Where we teach computers to do what comes naturally to humans.
A deep learning model learns to perform tasks such as image classifications, text vectorization or sound recognition etc. 
A driverless car, voice control or hands-free devices such as speakers are all examples of deep learning.

There is a lot of stuff available on Deep Learning on the web if you want to dive deep into it. My focus however, is to provide a basic level of understanding on how to quick start with the Deep Learning and then from there onwards build on the basis developed.

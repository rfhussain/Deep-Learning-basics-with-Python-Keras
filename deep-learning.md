# Deep Learning

Deep learning is a part of [Machine Learning](https://github.com/rfhussain/Topic-Modeling-with-Python-Scikit-LDA/blob/master/machine-learning.md) technique. Where we teach computers to do what comes naturally to humans.
A deep learning model learns to perform tasks such as image classifications, text vectorization or sound recognition etc. 
A driverless car, voice control or hands-free devices such as speakers are all examples of deep learning.

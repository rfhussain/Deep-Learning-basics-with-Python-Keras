# Some Basics
Here we will study about Recurrent Neural Networks RNN and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Unit), this can be useful when using it to generate text from source corpus
We will read in source material and generate brand new text with same style as the source corpus.

### Artificial Neural Networks ANN:

Artificial Neural Networks or ANN have a base in biology.
We are going to see how we can mimic biological neuron with an artificial neuron, which is also known as Perceptron.

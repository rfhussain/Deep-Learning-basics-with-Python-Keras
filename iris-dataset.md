# The Iris Dataset

Letâ€™s get ourselves familier with the iris dataset which will be used in the coding samples to do our machine learning example. 

The iris dataset contains measurements of flower petals, sepals, and has corresponding labels to one of the three classes (3 flower species)

So the dataset contains 50 samples for each class. And four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) are available for each item in this dataset. 
Based on these four features, a linier discriminant model has been developed to distinguish each species from each other.
